5. Key Insights
- Before vaccination (Jan 2020 – Mar 2021), daily new cases stayed low.
- After July 2021 (public rollout), daily cases surged (Delta/Omicron waves).
- Vaccination helped reduce severity (deaths per case) though infections rose.

6. Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates the full data analytics process:
1. Ask – Define key question
2. Prepare – Collect WHO dataset
3. Process – Clean & filter Vietnam data
4. Analyze – Compare pre/post vaccination trends
5. Share – Build interactive Tableau dashboard
6. Act – Derive insights on public health impact
